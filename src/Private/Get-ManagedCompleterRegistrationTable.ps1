.SYNOPSIS
Gets the managed registration dictionary from module state.

.DESCRIPTION
Returns the dictionary stored in the module state under the Registrations key.
This helper centralizes validation of that member so callers can work with the
registration table without repeating state-shape checks.

.OUTPUTS
System.Collections.IDictionary
Returns the dictionary that stores managed completer registration records by key.

.EXAMPLE
PS> $registrations = Get-ManagedCompleterRegistrationTable

Retrieves the backing registration table before adding, finding, or removing
managed completer records inside module internals.

function Get-ManagedCompleterRegistrationTable
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([System.Collections.IDictionary])]
    param()

    $state = Get-CompleterActionState
    $registrations = $state['Registrations']

    if ($registrations -isnot [System.Collections.IDictionary])
    {
        throw 'Module state property ''Registrations'' must be a dictionary-backed object.'
    }

    return $registrations
}
